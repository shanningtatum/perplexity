                <div class="panel">
                    <p>While we suggest sticking to the recommended number of players for each room, you may participate with fewer players provided it meets the minimum number of players for that room. For safety reasons, the recommended maximum number of players must be adhered to.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>If you need to leave the room once play has started, you are able to do so. However, please note, if you exit before your time is up without completing the mission, this would be considered a failed mission and the game is over. Unfortunately, we cannot issue a refund for failed missions. Please ensure participants visit the restrooms before starting game play as necessary as any bathroom breaks taken after the timer has started will end your game.</p>

                    <p>If you get stumped, there will always be a way to contact your Game Master for help or clarification. There's no limit on the number of clues you can ask for, BUT in order to qualify for our leaderboard, you'll want to use 2 clues or less!</p>
